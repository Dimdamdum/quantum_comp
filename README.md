Here is some quantum computation related code written while learning qiskit.

In particular, quantum_circuit_processing.ipynb presents a post-transpilation scheme to enhance the precision of quantum circuits by taking into account quantum computer errors and qubit connectivity in a device-specific way, using Qiskit. This was my contribution to the Qiskit hackaton at the World of Quantum 2025 fair.
